Key observations:

* Every input element has some border style set to inset (border-top is always black) . Reset that using border-style="solid" or with border-color
* Wrap Every input element with a wrapper that makes your life easy while styling
* Make sure you always add label to the input element and attach for with input id
* Define width for label element for better alignment 
* Radio-Buttons - Using fieldset with legened while using radio buttons since they works in groups and name attribute should be same for all buttons.
